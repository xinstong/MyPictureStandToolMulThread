This is one easy program to standard the picture read by qt.
	1. Using the qt thread, if you use it never, you can refer this.
	   Progress bar is using.
	2. Scan all the file in some directory.
	3. QImage read some picture[not standard for qt], write back using QImage, they will
	   be standard for qt.

Good luck!
